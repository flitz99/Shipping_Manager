# Shipping_Manager
This project is about a shipping manager. The clients register with the registration form, by inserting an username, password and street. After registering, a client can create a new shipment, normal or insured. The clients can see all their shipment, while the admin whit credentials already set can see the shipment about all the registered clients. The admin can modify the status of the client's shipment.
